# ASTNest ðŸª¹ðŸŒ²

ASTNest: code parsing, AST magic, and code transformation experiments!
Diving into the structure of code: analyzing, transforming, and refactoring code efficiently.

### Key Areas of Focus

- Code Parsing & Analysis  
  Internals of code, performing syntax and lexical analysis.

- AST Manipulation  
  Tree traversal, node manipulation, and code refactoring.

- Code Transformation & Migration  
  Tools to transform code syntax, rename variables, migrate to newer syntax versions, and even convert across languages.

## ðŸ“‚ Repositories

- Small-Scale Projects - Basic parsing tools and linters.
- Medium-Scale Projects - Static code analysis, complexity checks, and basic refactoring.
- Large-Scale Projects - Automated refactoring tools and full-code migration systems.
